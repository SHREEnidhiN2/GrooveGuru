**Groove Guru** is a dynamic web-based music streaming application that offers users a seamless experience in managing and enjoying their favorite tunes. At its core, Groove Guru allows users to create and manage playlists effortlessly. The application’s logic, powered by JavaScript, handles the intricate details of adding, removing, and organizing songs within these playlists, ensuring that users can easily curate their music collections according to their preferences.

One of the standout features of Groove Guru is its responsive design, which ensures that the application looks and functions beautifully across a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

Interactivity is a key component of Groove Guru, with JavaScript playing a crucial role in enhancing user engagement. For example, when users interact with the app by clicking buttons to play or pause music, adjust the volume, or select songs, JavaScript handles these actions seamlessly. This makes the application intuitive and responsive to user inputs, providing a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

The user interface (UI) of Groove Guru is carefully designed using HTML and CSS. HTML provides the structural foundation of the app, organizing content and elements into a coherent layout. CSS adds the visual styling, ensuring that the app is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The UI includes well-designed pages for browsing through music, managing playlists, and interacting with the player interface, which features controls for play, pause, skip, and volume adjustments.

Groove Guru’s audio playback functionality is robust and reliable, thanks to the integration of JavaScript with the HTML5 `<audio>` element. This combination allows for efficient management of music playback, including playing, pausing, and skipping songs. Additionally, Groove Guru’s music library, which consists of songs stored locally or fetched from a server, is dynamically displayed through JavaScript, allowing users to browse and select their favorite tracks with ease.

In summary, Groove Guru combines the power of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive, interactive, and user-friendly music streaming application that caters to music lovers across all devices.
